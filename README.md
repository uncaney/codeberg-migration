## ðŸš€ Transition to Codeberg.org

Hello everyone!

I wanted to share that I have officially switched from GitHub to [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)! ðŸŽ‰

### Why I Made the Switch

1. **Ethical Concerns**: GitHub is owned by Microsoft, which raises concerns about data privacy and corporate influence over open-source projects. I prefer a platform that prioritizes community values.

2. **Data Ownership**: GitHub's policies can be restrictive regarding data ownership and user privacy. Codeberg emphasizes user control over data, which is crucial for me.

3. **Non-Profit Model**: Codeberg operates as a non-profit, focusing on serving the community rather than maximizing profits, unlike GitHub.

4. **Community Focus**: Codeberg fosters a supportive and collaborative environment, making it easier to connect with like-minded developers.

### Why You Should Consider Switching

- **Support Ethical Development**: By choosing Codeberg, you support a platform that values open-source principles and community engagement.

- **Enhance Your Privacy**: Codeberg provides a safer environment for your projects, prioritizing user privacy.

- **Join a Growing Community**: Engage with a vibrant community that shares your values and passion for collaboration.
